# Data Structures and Algorithms
# A1 - Linked List Menu
This console application demonstrates linked list operations on club structures.

# A2 - Time Complexity Analysis
This document analyzes time complexities and running times.

# A3 - Recurrence Analysis
This document analyzes recurrence relations of recursive algorithms and documents multithreading \
using the OpenMP API.

# A4 - Tree Analysis
This document analyzes tree algorithms.

# A5 - Hash Tables
This console application demonstrates how a hash table is created using a hashing algorithm.

# A6 = Binary Trees
This console application demonstrates various operations on a user-defined Binary Search Tree.

# A7 - Graphs
This console application reads a given graph from standard input, generates the same graph in memory, \
then performs a depth-first-search on the graph and outputs the resulting DFS tree.

# A8 - Floyd-Warshall
This console application demonstrates the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for all pairs of a defined graph matrix.
